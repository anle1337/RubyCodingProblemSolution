# Description:

# Your goal in this kata is to implement an difference function, which subtracts one list from another.

# It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

# array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
# If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

# array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]


# My Answer and best method:

def array_diff(a, b)
  a - b
end


# Test :
Test.describe("Basic Tests") do
Test.assert_equals(array_diff([1,2], [1]), [2], "a was [1,2], b was [1], expected [2]")
Test.assert_equals(array_diff([1,2,2], [1]), [2,2], "a was [1,2,2], b was [1], expected [2,2]")
Test.assert_equals(array_diff([1,2,2], [2]), [1], "a was [1,2,2], b was [2], expected [1]")
Test.assert_equals(array_diff([1,2,2], []), [1,2,2], "a was [1,2,2], b was [], expected [1,2,2]")
Test.assert_equals(array_diff([], [1,2]), [], "a was [], b was [1,2], expected []")
